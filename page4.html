                    <p>Hello,</p>

                    <p>We wanted to let you know that we are making some updates to our Subscriber Agreement.
                    </p>

                    <p>These terms will apply as of January 25, 2024 for new subscribers. For prior and existing
                        subscribers, like you, these terms will be effective beginning on March 14, 2024, unless you
                        acknowledge an in-app notice of these changes earlier. Until then, the terms of our prior
                        agreement apply.</p>

                    <p>We encourage you to review the updated Subscriber Agreement in full and save a copy for your
                        files. Once effective, it will govern your use and enjoyment of your Zulu subscription. We
                        are
                        as committed as ever to making sure you have an enjoyable streaming experience. Please visit
                        our
                        Help Center for more information about your subscription. We have highlighted some of the
                        changes for your reference: </p>

                    <p> - We're adding limitations on sharing your account outside of your household, and explaining
                        how
                        we may assess your compliance with these limitations. </p>

                    <p> - We're updating aspects of our dispute resolution policies, including terms related to
                        choice
                        of law and updates to the arbitration agreement to be more specific about the procedures for
                        resolving any disputes relating to your subscription and our services, and to offer you the
                        choice to “opt out” of resolving disputes through arbitration. </p>
